Developed a fuzzy system for Smart Energy Management Systems (SEMS) based on issues regarding United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).
Specifically, SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and SDG 13 (Climate Action) that is caused by inefficient usage of urban energies.
The system is designed to optimize energy consumption and reduce energy waste in buildings by utilizing fuzzy logic to targeting HVAC systems and light sources.
It adapts energy use based on factors such as room size, time of day, and external temperatures, and light intensity in aim of optimising cooling intensity of HVAC systems and light intensity of light sources present.
The results are displayed in a both 3d and 2d plots.
